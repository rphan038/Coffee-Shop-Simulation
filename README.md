This project is a simulation of a coffee shop where given an input of customer arrival times, the simulation calculates
the total profit, total cost of hiring a set number of cashiers, the net profit the coffee shop makes, the average wait
time for a customer who waits in line, maximum wait time of any customer, and the overflow rate. This simulation is used
to run experiments to help determine the optimal number of cashiers the coffee shop owner should hire in order to maximize
profit.
